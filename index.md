## [](#header-2)About Me

Welcome to the student showcase website I built while getting my Master's degree at Colorado School of Mines! I'm currently employed as a Software Engineer with 3 years of on the job experience - resume is available upon request if you are interested in learning more about my professional work as well.

When this website was originally built, I was a Master's student at the Colorado School of Mines, completing a major in Computer Science. My specialties are Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Robotics. To learn more about my robotics research, feel free to visit my [Software Page](/software) and the [MirrorLab](http://mirrorlab.mines.edu/people.html) website. The MirrorLab is a Colorado School of Mines on-campus lab that focuses on unearthing new and exciting technologies in the field of Human Robot Interaction, and applying those discoveries to robotic systems. I was a member of the MirrorLab during my Master's degree, and this experience showed me what incredible things Computer Science can accomplish.

I attended Colorado State University in undergraduate, and majored in Biology with a minor in Mathematics. I have extensive experience applying biological concepts to the field of software. By imitating biological systems, we can bring the simplicity and elegance of nature to our software designs. For instance, neural networks were conceived of by simplifying the structure of the brain, and are now a basic tenent of machine learning. I hope to continue finding ways to combine my passion for biology with my passion for software.
